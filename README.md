# _KiCAD Libraries_

This repo contains symbol, footprint and step model libraries for KiCAD. Containing parts I often use or would like to explore. The goal here is to avoid using the generic parts that KiCAD provides which makes BOM generation tricky.

## Built With

- [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Used to automate some symbol generation
- [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview) - Used to design certain unavailable packages

## Authors
